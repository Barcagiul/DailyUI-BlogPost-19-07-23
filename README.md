TODAY'S CHALLENGE
Blog Post
Design a structured page for your blog posts.

via DailyUI.com

Note: For this, I will be using the previous day's challenge as a
baseplate (as the challenge was for a blog card). Therefore, 
the index page will not be the main page and instead the page will
be a redirectory following from one of the blog cards. 
These redirectories will not be available from the previous
day's repository, only this one.
